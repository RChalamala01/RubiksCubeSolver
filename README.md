# Rubik's Cube Solving Robot (WIP)

Complete:
Rubik's cube implementation and solver completed in C++. Returns a step by step method to solve a Rubik's cube from a given scramble.

To-Do:
Implement the Rubik's cube in C# in Unity and create a script to interface between the C++ program and the Unity model.
Design and 3D print pieces necessary to build the robot.
Program the motors given the steps needed to solve through the use of an Arduino.
Use OpenCV and the Raspberry Pi in order to scan the cube to use an input.
